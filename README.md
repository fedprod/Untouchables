# Untouchables
A mod for OpenXcom Extended that adds a new Soldier type and two powerful Transformations. This expands and extends upon https://openxcom.mod.io/immortals-for-x-com-files by heelys, so Credit for the original Idea goes there :)

OpenXcom Extended 7.8 is needed at at least for the base games.  
The X-Com Files version needs at least 2.7, and the Arsenal Additions version 0.8.1b!

## Features
  - A new race of Soldiers  
    More expensive troops, but they come with higher basic Stats and growth potential
	
  - New Transformations  
    Two Expensive Procedures with a mandatory reconvalescence of 1 day
	- Regeneration  
	Gets a wounded Soldier back on their feet
	- Resurrection  
	Completely revives a dead Soldier

## Installation
Extract the four folders from the downloaded archive into your `OpenXcom Extended/user/mods` folder.  
Since OpenXcom reads a tag from the metadata.yml, only the correct mod will show up in the mod list, so you can just drop them all in.

## Versions
For anyone wondering what the Folders are for:
   - UntouchablesXCOM1 is for UFO: Enemy Unknown / X-COM: UFO Defense
   - UntouchablesXCOM2 is for X-COM: Terror From the Deep
   - UntouchablesXCF is for the highly recommended The X-Com Files mod https://openxcom.old.mod.io/the-x-com-files
   - UntouchablesXCFA is a compatibility addon for X-Com Files Arsenal Additions https://openxcom.old.mod.io/x-com-files-additions

## Customization
Since all the mod data is just a bunch of clear text YAML formated .rul files, you can dig around and change things to your hearts content.
